# C-Beginning

This repository is a collection of my journey in learning C programming. I am new to programming in general and have chosen to start with C as my first language. The goal is to build a solid foundation in programming before venturing into other languages like Python and eventually diving into the field of machine learning.

## My Learning Objectives

1. **C Programming:** Master the fundamentals of C programming, including syntax, data structures, and algorithms.
2. **Python Development:** Transition to Python programming language to expand my coding skills.
3. **Machine Learning:** Begin the journey into machine learning, starting with the basics and gradually advancing my knowledge.

## Progress Tracking

I will use this repository to track my progress, share code snippets, and document my learning experiences. Feel free to explore the code, offer feedback, or follow along with my journey.
